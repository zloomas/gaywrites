<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gaywrites is to take academic abstracts and make them just a
little bit gayer.

## Installation

You can install `gaywrites` like so:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("zloomas/gaywrites")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to make gay modifications to
a typical academic abstract from a social-behavioral science article:

``` r
library(gaywrites)
```

## Upcoming

-   Handle search/replace instances at the end of a sentence.
-   Generalize methods to handle other parts of speech besides units of
    observation.
